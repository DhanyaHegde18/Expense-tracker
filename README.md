# Expense-tracker
It is about tracking the budget we spend on different things like food, shopping, or transport.
Users can set a budget based on their needs â€” weekly, monthly, or yearly.
The system will track their expenses according to the budget.
If they exceed their budget, it will send them an alert so they can analyze and understand their spending habits.
